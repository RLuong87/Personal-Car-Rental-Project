# Personal-Project

Personal application using Java SpringBoot and MySQL for the back end.

This personal project that I am building is a fishing weather application. The goal is to allow users to check weather, check low tide and/or high tide before a day of fishing. Other features may include suggestions of proper attire in accordance with the climate on any given day. They can also get information on rules and regulations provided by their local DEM.
